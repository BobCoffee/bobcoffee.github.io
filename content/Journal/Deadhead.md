  My worked consisted of photo documentation, photo editing and film processing, archival and experimental research as well as assisting art direction and even art contsruction.  Working for Bomford had opened my eyes to the art practice and was fascinating to be apart of a creative process that was rather more humanistic and fluid then design. When I was brought into the project, Deadhead had already been under construction for a year and the centerpiece, affectionately named the beercan, had been mostly constructed. This eclectic sculpture had been built with some salvaged wood and some new lumber in a pastiche style reminiscent of Dieter Roth’s work.
