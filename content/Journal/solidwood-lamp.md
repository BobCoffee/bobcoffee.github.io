  The objective of this project was to design a home object based on an essay from Sherry Turkleâ€™s book, Evocative Objects. This process began with the short essay The Axe Head by David Mitten. Inspired by the description of an axe chopping into wood, The Solidwood Lamp was designed to transition from its natural form at the base to a man-made aesthetic with the bulb. This play between the organic and the manmade forms expresses the relationship between the origins of the material from which the lamp is made and its function.

  Built from a solid round of spruce, the form of the lamp changes from the natural wood into a manmade square which invites you to touch the smooth surface. Drawing from the inspiration of the axe, the cuts into the spruce round resemble the appearance of axe blows in a tree. Finishing flat and sitting on the top is the bare light. The rings at the top of the lamp enhance the radiance of light from the source.
