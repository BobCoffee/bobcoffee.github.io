I find this to be a very interesting topic, being a user experience designer. But, I feel stuck between two sides here. One could argue that users need to take control of their digital habits and prevent passive obedience to their phones. Another could say that it is the fault of software companies and startups striving to retain that beautiful metric of “engagement”.

Recently, I had a meeting with my design team discussing focus and goal setting. We had talked about how to remain focused and not become distracted at work. I noticed that a lot of the issues we had discussed lead us back to push notifications and strategies of digital sunsets. Finishing the meeting we had felt energised, goal-oriented and ready to get down to work. One minute UX and visual designers discussing focus and the next working on engagement strategies. Needless to say the irony of this situation was not lost on me.

My father and oldest brother are both engineers and it is interesting to see there is a shared understanding of duty to uphold safety and integrity. They have taken an oath to protect the public from catastrophic collapses and failures. Should there be a similar vow in UX design to protect the mental health of the public? Is there a standard we should abide by? Perhaps I am being too lofty, but as UX designers we have an obligation to recognise that engagement shouldn’t be the greatest measure of success. How do we change the value of attention? It seems like a mammoth task, which goes back to my original argument. Is it the fault of the end user who isn’t self-regulating or does the blame lie with start-ups using every tick in the book to retain their attention? I believe it’s deeper than this and actually is a systemic issue.

Revenue is generated, for a majority of apps, through advertising and advertising requires engagement to be considered successful. There are many businesses kept aloft by advertising revenue, but this can be precarious. For example, Facebook is currently embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica Scandal. Cambridge Analytica had not only collected data from people who voluntarily, however some would argue unknowingly, consented access; They had harvested their friends list and spread. Which according to facebook it is well within their terms and conditions. This is what makes facebook so powerful for their advertisers. This has caused such a scandal because data was used to influence democratic elections in the United States . The scandal has resulted in a loss of $58 billion of its market value. This is no small amount - Roughly the size of Costa Rica or Croatia’s entire economy.

<p id="post-box" class="break">
Does engagement for advertising dollars have to be the greatest metric is we strive for? Is there another way to create a stable business or startup with revenue growth. Or maybe that is giving too much responsibility to these businesses? Should it be up to the end user to decide how much time is too much. Should they be more aware that these interactions are meant to help and delight users through a product and nothing more? My position is both. I think users should be aware of what they are using, but knowledge comes from understanding of the intentions of the designer and I hope I did that here.
