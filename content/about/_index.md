description = "Beginning my career in Art Direction I worked in the advertising industry before relocating to Berlin. To expand my knowledge of design I attended Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver where I studied industrial design and photography. During my study I worked as a researcher at the university's design lab, as an artist assistant for a world renowned artist and became heavily involved in Vancouver's tech start-up scene. I currently live and work in Melbourne, Australia for accounting software firm MYOB."
