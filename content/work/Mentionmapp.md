  I was responsible for building the Mentionmapp brand, redesigning the homepage, app and interface design and addressing the usability of the app. The design of the brand needed to feel approachable and friendly as well as analytical and smart. The app was previously built in Flash and is now updated to HTML5. Usability of the new app was crucial with a visual and complex tool, the use of colour was important to help guide the user.
