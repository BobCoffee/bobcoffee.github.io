  I began work with Spacelist as a part of a collaboration between GrowLab (a Vancouver based startup accelerator) and Emily Carr University to inject design thinking and process into startups at GrowLab. I worked with Spacelist to create a cohesive email strategy and campaign to foster a close relationship with our users. By the end of my semester at GrowLab. This successful project allowed me to come on as their UX designer to deliver high caliber work across their entire site.
