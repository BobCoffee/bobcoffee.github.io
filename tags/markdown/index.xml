      <description>The challenge of this project was to design a table from a single sheet of 60x60 Â¾ inch birch plywood with minimal waste.kept the form of the table very simple with clean lines and aesthetically modern. One of the greatest features is the laminated legs, which allows the table to have a unique form and remain very stable. From cutlist to assembly the table took, in all, five hours to build.</description>
